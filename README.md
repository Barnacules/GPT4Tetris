# GPT4Tetris v1.0 AI Generated Tetris Clone
The entire Python source code for this video game inside GPT4Python.py was generated from a single conversation with GPT4 via ChatGPT Premium. All of the features added, bug fixes and tweaks were done by just asking the AI for changes and describing issues so it could resolve them. I even was able to upload a screen shot for one of the bugs that it couldn't figure out and when it viewed the screen shot using the new vision feature it was able to immediately discover the bug and give me updated code that fixed it. AI is going to take all our jobs at some point so we might as well have some fun with it before it does. I want to interate just one more time that this entire source code including the comments were 100% generated by ChatGPT after going back and fourth about 50 times throughout the course of the conversation to get the final source code. The entire source code in the end was printed out with multiple "Continues" since the code was longer than a single response but what you see in the file is the unedited code from ChatGPT. How insane is this?!

# Notes
If you enjoy this project please hit me up @barnacules on Twitter and let me know what you think. Also, I was able to get more bug fixes by talking to the AI more and more and I'll upload the final version later when I have more time to test it and make sure I didn't miss anything. But the few bugs that you do see are just due to some order of operations that got messed up when it output the final code and can easily be fixed by just changing the drawing order. But overall it's a fully functional Tetris game which is just amazing to me considering it was completely written by an AI by me just asking it for things. The future of software development is going to be language agnostic since you'll just basically describe the program and what it does and get the end result in any language for any platform at the rate things are evolving right now.
